## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Access the admin panel**:
   - URL: http://localhost:7000/admin
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123

3. **Create a task**:
   - Place Python files in `tasks/` directory
   - Must have `run_task(config)` function
   - System will auto-discover new tasks
